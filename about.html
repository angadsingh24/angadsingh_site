        <h3> Who am I?</h4>
        <p> 
            I'm an 18-year old from NJ interested in programming, entrepreneurship, and business. 
            I am also passionate about social change, and hope to use computer science to 
            design solutions to real-world problems, like access to education. 
            This is a problem I have already begun to combat - in 2021, 
            I co-founded a nonprofit organization called Academic Advancements to make
            education more accessible for underprivileged students around the world.
        </p>
        <h3> What do I value?</h3>
        <p>
            Commitment is very important to me - if I start a project, I will stick with it, 
            not give up when it gets difficult. I also value communication - clear communications
            is essential in every aspect of life, including building projects and having successful relationships,
        </p>
        <h4> What do I study?</h4>
        <p> I am a freshman at the University of Michigan studying Computer Science, and hope 
            to pursue a dual major/minor at the Ross School of Business. My eventual career goals 
            include working in quantitative finance, entrepreneurship, or software engineering.  </p>
